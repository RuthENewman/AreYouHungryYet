# Are You Hungry Yet? - https://ruthenewman.github.io/AreYouHungryYet/

Day 1 of challenge to build 30 vanilla JS projects over 30 days (displaying sliding images of different kinds of food)

A vanilla JS project with three primary files (index.html, index.js and style.css), as well as 6 image files for the images
in the slider gallery.

Set timeout can be updated to changed the speed of the slider.

# Design

Basic styling to centre the images and header and to fill the background without distracting from the images themselves.
